# Traffic Accident Analysis Project

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover insights into accident hotspots and contributing factors. The analysis includes exploring how various factors such as weather conditions, road types, and time influence the frequency and severity of accidents.

## Objectives

- To analyze traffic accident data to understand patterns and trends.
- To identify accident hotspots based on geographical locations.
- To investigate the relationship between road conditions, weather, time of day, and accident occurrences.
- To visualize findings to communicate insights effectively.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathering traffic accident data from reliable sources such as government databases or open data portals.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing distributions, correlations, and summary statistics of accident data.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping accident locations to visualize hotspots using tools like GeoPandas or Leaflet.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examining accident trends based on time of day, day of week, and seasonal variations.
- **Visualization**: Creating interactive plots, heatmaps, and charts to illustrate accident patterns and contributing factors.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **GeoPandas/Folium**: For geospatial data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and presentation.
